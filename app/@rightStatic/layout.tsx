/**
 * Right Static Layout - Parallel Route Slot for Static Content
 *
 * ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO-JS COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT
 *
 * This layout is part of a parallel routes architecture designed for static site generation (SSG).
 *
 * 🚫 DO NOT USE loading.tsx IN THIS SLOT
 *
 * Why? Loading states break progressive enhancement and no-JavaScript functionality:
 *
 * 1. Static Generation Conflict:
 *    - Parallel routes with @rightStatic are meant for static HTML generation
 *    - loading.tsx introduces client-side rendering dependencies
 *    - This prevents proper static HTML export during build time
 *
 * 2. No-JS Requirement:
 *    - Users with JavaScript disabled must see content immediately
 *    - loading.tsx requires JavaScript to display content after hydration
 *    - Static pages should render complete HTML without client-side dependencies
 *
 * 3. SEO Impact:
 *    - Search engine crawlers may not execute JavaScript
 *    - Content behind loading states might not be indexed
 *    - Static HTML ensures all content is crawlable
 *
 * ✅ Best Practices:
 *    - Use Suspense boundaries in dynamic slots (@rightDynamic) instead
 *    - Keep this slot purely static with complete HTML at build time
 *    - Place loading states in client components, not route-level loading.tsx
 *    - Use skeleton screens directly in page components if needed
