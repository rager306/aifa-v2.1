      question: "Can you integrate AI into our existing website or mobile application?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this is feasible for most modern tech stacks. I audit your architecture (frontend/backend), prepare technical documentation covering AI SDK integration points, including RAG mechanisms, agents, and knowledge base connectivity. The documentation enables your team to test, stage, and deploy to production with minimal risk. If you lack internal resources, I can implement the integration myself or collaborate closely with your developers.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of AI chat systems do you develop?",
      answer:
        "Built on the latest AI SDK with flexible architecture tailored to your business. I implement various patterns: from embedded prompts with context to hybrid solutions orchestrating vector knowledge bases (Pinecone, Weaviate), Redis caching, and PostgreSQL. Integration with any model (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Gemini, open-source LLaMA) and tuning for your KPIs: response time, accuracy, cost per query. Analytics dashboards and continuous learning loops based on user feedback are also available.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you develop asset tokenization systems, blockchain, and Web3 solutions?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this is a priority area. In partnership with an experienced business analyst and B2B product manager, I offer end-to-end delivery: from concept to Security Token Offering (STO) launch with legal compliance and regulatory alignment. Platform built on Node.js, smart contract integration (Solidity/EVM, standards ERC-20, ERC-1404, ERC-3643 for compliance), supporting both private and public blockchains. We tokenize real estate, intellectual property, and fractional assets with KYC/AML processes and secondary market infrastructure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you consider full-time employment opportunities?",
      answer:
        "Yes, open to discussing full-time roles at companies working at the intersection of Next.js, Web3, and AI. Particularly interested in Technical Lead, Solution Architect, or Product Engineer positions where I can apply 25 years of experience in architecture, team leadership, and product launches. I prefer projects with clear business strategy where technology enables growth, not just tech for techs sake.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your minimum rate, and do you accept freelance projects?",
      answer:
        "Rates start at 40 EUR/hour. Key advantage: extensive library of ready-made solutions (AIFA starters, AI/Web3 modules, Next.js 15 components) that dramatically reduce timelines—projects estimated at months often complete in days of focused work. I accept freelance projects if theyre technically interesting and require architectural thinking, not just basic implementation. Minimum engagement: 2-hour consultation (80 EUR) with roadmap and estimate.",
