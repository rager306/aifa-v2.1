Yet businesses still need SEO—because organic traffic is free, predictable, and dominates conversion funnels. AIFA's architectural pattern resolves this historic tension by using Next.js parallel routes to serve static SEO content in one slot and dynamic AI-driven interfaces in another—simultaneously, without compromise. This isn't just a technical trick; it's a new UI/UX paradigm for web applications of the future.",

      answer:
        "Technically yes—you could order flowers or book tickets entirely within a chat interface. But brand identity, visual storytelling, and marketing campaigns still demand custom designs that break free from generic chat bubbles. AIFA lets businesses maintain both: AI chat for efficiency, custom pages for brand expression.",

    {
      question: "How does AIFA achieve SEO perfection while offering AI chat experiences?",
      answer:
        "AIFA uses parallel routes: the @rightStatic slot contains pure server-rendered HTML for search engines, while @rightDynamic overlays interactive AI chat for authenticated users. Search crawlers see only static content; logged-in users get dynamic experiences.",

    {
      question: "Do I need to rebuild my entire site to use this architecture?",

    {
      question: "What happens on mobile devices with narrow screens?",
